      <h2>Brand Concept</h2>
      <p class="senior-p">Clouro believes that everyone should have access to the information they need to make sustainable fashion decisions. In a world saturated by greenwashing tactics designed to hide harmful policies and strip consumers of their purchasing agency, Clouro aims to cut through the noise and provide consumers with the truth that they deserve.

    <div class="naming-c1">
      <h3>Naming</h3>
      <p class="senior-p">The name Clouro is derived from the ouroboros, an ancient symbol depicting a snake or dragon eating it’s own tail that represents the cycle of destruction and rebirth. </p>
      <p class="senior-p">The ouroboros supports the brand’s focus on circular fashion and the desire to create a ‘closed-loop’ consumption culture that values recycling and regeneration. While the symbol itself is not an explcit brand element, it’s story will live in the brand through circular elements as an elevated motif. </p>

    <div class="user-interviews">
<h3>User Interviews</h3>
<p class="senior-p">To begin the research process, my classmate Kara Rondinelli and I created a strategic plan with specific objectives to gather data that would help us understand our users effectively. Our first research method involved conducting user interviews, during which we created 39 open-ended questions to ask participants about their knowledge of sustainable fashion, current clothing consumption habits, perceptions of brand transparency, trust in clothing brands, awareness of clothing quality, and preferences for educational content and sustainability support.</p>
<p class="senior-p">Both Kara and I conducted 4 interviews.</p>
</div>
  <div class="user-survey">
  <h3>User Survey</h3>
<p class="senior-p">After the user interviews, Kara and I created an online survey to continue empathizing with and building our understanding of our users. This survey included 27 multiple-choice questions and was shared with our friends and family, coworkers, and published twice in the UConn Student Daily Digest email newsletter, which is received by all undergraduate students. In less than a week, we collected 158 responses. Based on this survey data and the user interview responses, we identified 8 key insights 5 primary pain points.</p>
</div>
</section>
  <div class="key-insights">
<h3>Key Insights</h3>
<ul class="keyi-grid">
<li>Most people want to shop more sustainably but aren’t exactly sure what it entails to do so.</li>
<li>Money and lack of knowledge are the biggest barriers in making more sustainable fashion choices and purchasing high-quality garments.</li>
<li>Price and quality are the most important factors that influence consumer purchasing decisions, while sustainability is a lower priority.</li>
<li>People don’t trust and struggle to verify clothing brands’ transparency and sustainability claims.</li>
<li>People prefer to engage with educational content through social media (i.e. short/long-form videos and infographics) and articles.</li>
<li>People want to or already engage in practices to extend the life of their clothes, such as sewing and mending.</li>
<li>Most people would pay more for high quality or sustainable clothing depending on the price difference.</li>
<li>People have limited knowledge of materials and attempt to verify clothing quality by physical attributes but are unable to distinguish between high-quality and/or sustainable materials versus those that are not.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3 class="pp-h3">Pain Points</h3>
<div class="pain-points">
<div class="pp1">
  <h4>Cost Concerns</h4>
  <p>High prices are a significant barrier to purchasing high-quality and sustainable clothing. Many consumers feel that sustainable options are too expensive.</p>
</div>
<div class="pp2">
  <h4>Prioritization of Other Factors</h4>
  <p>Price and quality are often a higher priority than sustainability, making it difficult for consumers to shift their purchasing habits.</p>
</div>
<div class="pp3">
  <h4>Lack of Knowledge</h4>
  <p>Many users are unsure about what constitutes sustainability, how to verify brand claims, which brands are genuinely sustainable or not, and which materials are high-quality or sustainable. This uncertainty makes it challenging to make informed choices.</p>
</div>
<div class="pp4">
  <h4>Insufficient Educational Resources</h4>
  <p>Users prefer engaging educational content, but there’s a lack of accessible information that explains sustainability in a clear, concise, and compelling manner.</p>
</div>
<div class="pp5">
  <h4>Time and Skill Constraints</h4>
<p>Many consumers lack the time to educate themselves about sustainable practices or to shop sustainably in general. Additionally, some feel they do not have the skills needed or time to learn about garment maintenance and repair, which can discourage sustainable clothing practices.</p>

<h2>Empathy Maps</h2>

These outline the goals, thoughts, actions, and pain points of the personas through stages of awareness, searching for sustainable clothing, making a purchase, and upon receiving the sustainable item. This helped me recognize areas for improvement and develop possible solutions within each stage of their journeys.</p>

  <p>Clouro's high-fidelity app prototype is a comprehensive tool for purchasing and learning about sustainable fashion.

  <p>The app also aims to educate consumers on sustainability beyond the purchase through clothing care and repair tips, thrift store recommendations, and more.  Key features include clear sustainability ratings and information, clothing lifespan metrics, personalized educational content, and community forums. </p>

  <h2>User Testing Round 1: Low-Fidelity</h2>
  <p>For the first round of user testing, I observed 3 users complete 3 tasks, which included:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Locate the "Juniper T-Shirt"</li>
      <li>Locate an article about fashion and the environment.</li>
      <li>Locate information about the brand "Mighty Good Basics" </li>
    </ul>
</section>
<section class="lowfi-test1">
  <div class="lowfi-test1-type">
    <h3>Original Prototype Flow</h3>
    <p>The first task was most challenging for users, but the subsequent tasks-locating articles and brand information-were completed seamlessly. Key moments of frustration and confusion include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>All three users got stuck on the "Browse by Clothing Item" filter page and didn't expect to have to click another button ("View Items") after pressing "Tops" to be taken to the products.</li>
      <li>Users expected to find a brand listed under "Clouro Approved Brands" on the shop page and to navigate to products from there.</li>
      <li>Two users thought the tags on the brand cards (e.g., "women's wear," "organic cotton") were clickable.</li>

<div class="changes-hifi">
<h3 class="changes-hifi-h3">Changes in High Fidelity</h3>
    <p>To improve usability and resolve the navigation issues I observed, I made many changes to the shop page, which include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Converted the "Shop by Clothing Item" button into a toggle with headers "By Brand" and "By Item" to clearly separate the two categories and indicate the user’s location on the page.</li>
      <li>Created a dedicated "By Item" page within the "Shop" section instead of using the previous pop-up filter.</li>
      <li>Made the toggle and its type bolder to catch users’ attention at the top of the page and prevent unnecessary scrolling through brands to find products.
      </li>
      <li>Replaced tags on brand cards with small text to eliminate the possibility of them being mistaken for buttons.
      </li>
    </ul>
