        <h4>LAWN CARE COMPANY</h4>
        <p>Ongoing marketing materials for Duck Pond Landscaping, Granby Connecticut's premier lawn care company. I was originally asked to create a business card for Duck Pond, which quickly grew into an all-encompassing brand campaign to elevate the local business.</p>

        <h2>Door Hangers</h2>
        <p class="p-dp">The objective was to create a clean, friendly design to advertise Duck Pond's services to potential new clients. I also focused on incorporating the branding elements created for the business card into the design to ensure cohesion. I collaborated with the client to develop a lighthearted concept for the door hangers centered around a positive customer review. </p>

    <h2>Website</h2>
    <p>For my most recent project with Duck Pond Landscaping, I was responsible for designing their first website. The client wanted a streamlined one-page site to effectively showcase their services, highlight photos of their best work, and provide a brief introduction to their business for the local community. To achieve this, I strategically incorporated buttons throughout the page, guiding visitors to an embedded form for easy access to free quotes. The design focused on a clean layout and intuitive navigation, catering specifically to Duck Pond's older customer base.</p>

  <div class="dp-website2">
    <p class="p-dp"> I collaborated closely with Melina Sandel, a classmate who developed the site, ensuring the design aligned with the clientâ€™s vision. This experience taught me valuable skills in communication and project coordination, as I balanced client feedback with questions and technical considerations from Melina throughout the process.</p>

      <p class="p-dp">The objective was to develop a clean design that aligns with industry trends but also creates a unique look for the company. The client also wanted me to develop a wordmark for the brand that could be used on the business card and future deliverables.</p>
